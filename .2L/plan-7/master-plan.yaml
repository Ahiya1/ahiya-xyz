  Single iteration approach for Premium B2B Positioning & 2L Deep Dive.
  All 3 master explorers unanimously recommend SINGLE ITERATION due to:
  - Focused scope (frontend-focused, existing design system)
  - No complex external integrations
  - Reusable existing patterns and CSS classes
  - Cohesive changes that relate to B2B positioning

  Work breakdown:
  1. Create /2l page (2L methodology deep-dive)
  2. Create /capabilities page (HTML with print styles)
  3. Update homepage B2B messaging + add CTA strip
  4. Update navigation (add 2L link)
  5. Add "Built with 2L" badges to project pages
  6. Premium styling enhancements

  Implementation order:
  - Builder-1: 2L page (requires 2L system knowledge from exploration)
  - Builder-2: Capabilities page + CTA strip
  - Builder-3: Homepage B2B refresh + nav update
  - Builder-4: Project page badges + premium touches
