# Master Plan: Plan-11 Immersive Project Worlds
# Generated: 2025-12-04
# Complexity: MEDIUM

plan_id: plan-11
iteration: 12
status: BUILDING

## Overview
Transform 3 project pages into immersive mini-worlds:
- Mirror of Dreams → Cosmic Reflection Chamber
- SelahReach → Command Center
- AI Research Pipeline → Research Lab

## Exploration Insights Summary

### Mirror of Dreams (from Explorer-1)
- 5 sacred reflection questions (not 4 as initially thought)
- 3 AI tones: Sacred Fusion (default), Gentle Clarity, Luminous Fire
- Visual palette: Deep navy (#0f0f23), purple gradients, golden accents
- Key vibe: "Consciousness recognition technology - no fixing, only truth"

### SelahReach (from Explorer-2)
- 7 pipeline stages: Lead → Contacted → Replied → Call Scheduled → Proposal → Won/Lost
- P.S. line: "This email was composed and sent by an AI system I built"
- Visual palette: Stage-specific colors (gray, blue, yellow, purple, orange, green, red)
- Key vibe: "AI-Operated CRM / Outreach Command Center"

### Current Pages (from Explorer-3)
- StatViz is gold standard with fixed ambient layer + gradient orbs
- Other 3 pages have demos but NO ambient backgrounds
- Key pattern: Fixed positioned layer with pointer-events-none
- Need: Floating particles, gradient orbs, breathing animations per theme

## Builder Assignments

builders:
  - builder_id: 1
    name: "Cosmic Reflection Chamber"
    files:
      - /app/projects/mirror-of-dreams/page.tsx
    task: |
      Transform Mirror of Dreams page into cosmic reflection chamber:

      1. ADD ambient background layer (fixed, pointer-events-none):
         - Multiple floating star particles (30-50)
         - Purple nebula gradient orbs (2-3 large blurs)
         - Gentle breathing animations

      2. UPDATE demo to use ACTUAL app elements:
         - Real 5 questions from Explorer-1 report
         - Tone selector: "Let the Mirror Breathe", "Gentle Clarity", "Luminous Fire"
         - Sample AI response in actual voice

      3. Visual identity:
         - Deep navy background (#0f0f23 to #1a1a2e)
         - Purple (#9333ea) and gold (#fbbf24) accents
         - Glass morphism cards
         - Golden mirror frame glow for output

      4. Breathing animations throughout

    dependencies: []

  - builder_id: 2
    name: "Command Center"
    files:
      - /app/projects/selahreach/page.tsx
    task: |
      Transform SelahReach page into command center:

      1. ADD ambient background layer:
         - Subtle grid pattern overlay
         - Data stream particles (10-15 horizontal/vertical)
         - Pulsing status dots in corners
         - Purple/green gradient orbs

      2. ENHANCE existing demos:
         - Kanban should feel more alive (breathing cards)
         - Terminal should have more operational feel
         - Add activity feed showing "recent actions"

      3. Visual identity:
         - Dark with subtle grid
         - Purple (#a78bfa) primary, green (#22c55e) for success
         - Terminal aesthetic touches

      4. The P.S. line should be highlighted prominently

    dependencies: []

  - builder_id: 3
    name: "Research Lab"
    files:
      - /app/projects/ai-research-pipeline/page.tsx
    task: |
      Transform AI Research Pipeline page into research lab:

      1. ADD ambient background layer:
         - Floating data points (20-30 particles)
         - Teal/cyan gradient orbs
         - Subtle diagonal light beam effects
         - Research grid overlay (very faint)

      2. ENHANCE existing demos:
         - Pipeline should feel like data transformation
         - Theme network should be more interactive (connection lines glow on hover)
         - Narrative cards should feel like research artifacts

      3. Visual identity:
         - Dark with data-grid subtle pattern
         - Teal/cyan (#22d3d8) primary
         - Scientific, precise aesthetic

    dependencies: []

  - builder_id: 4
    name: "CSS Animations"
    files:
      - /app/globals.css
    task: |
      Add new ambient animations to globals.css:

      1. Shared base animations:
         - ambient-float (floating particles)
         - ambient-drift (slow background drift)
         - ambient-pulse (gentle glow pulse)
         - star-twinkle

      2. Cosmic theme (Mirror of Dreams):
         - cosmic-nebula-breathe
         - cosmic-star-drift

      3. Command theme (SelahReach):
         - data-stream-flow
         - status-pulse
         - command-grid-overlay class

      4. Research theme (AI Research Pipeline):
         - research-data-drift
         - lab-light-beam
         - data-ring-pulse

      5. Reduced motion support for all

    dependencies: []

## Integration Strategy
- Pages are independent - minimal integration needed
- Each builder creates self-contained ambient layer
- CSS animations shared in globals.css
- Run builders 1-3 in parallel, builder 4 can also run in parallel

## Validation Criteria
- Build passes
- Lint passes
- Each page has distinct visual identity
- Ambient elements are subtle (not distracting)
- Reduced motion respected
- Mobile responsive
- Performance maintained (60fps target)

## Files NOT to Modify
- /app/projects/statviz/page.tsx (already gold standard)
- Site navigation
- Basic page structure
