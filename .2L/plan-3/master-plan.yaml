total_iterations: 1

strategy: |
  Single iteration approach. All work is frontend-only with no blocking dependencies.
  Homepage sections can be built sequentially in one file. Project pages are independent.
  Design patterns are fully established - maximize component and CSS reuse.

  Builder allocation:
  - Builder 1: Homepage redesign (Hero, About, Services, How I Work, Testimonial, CTA, Footer, Nav)
  - Builder 2: Project page upgrades (StatViz, Mirror of Dreams, Wealth - add Challenge/Solution)

  Content is fully specified in vision.md. Follow existing patterns from globals.css.
