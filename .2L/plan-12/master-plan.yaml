  - Merge Terminal + Dashboard into unified demo
  - Remove redundant sections (AgentViz, AgentTypes, SlashCommands, CodeGenDemo)
  - Add new "What Makes 2L Different" section
  - Replace meta-circular content with "customer-portal" hypothetical B2B project
  - Simplify Pipeline from 7 phases to 4 steps

      Update terminal animation to show "customer-portal" B2B demo:

      New sequence:
      $ /2l-mvp customer-portal
      [Vision] Customer portal with auth, dashboard, API
      [Exploring] Analyzing requirements...
      [Planning] 3 parallel builders assigned
        → Builder-1: Authentication system
        → Builder-2: Dashboard components
        → Builder-3: REST API endpoints
      [Building] Executing in parallel...
      [Validating] Running 47 tests...
      [Complete] All tests passing. Ready to deploy.

      Remove all references to "plan-9", "ahiya-xyz", or meta-circular content.

    name: "2L Page Restructure"
    files:
      - /home/ahiya/Ahiya/2L/Prod/ahiya-xyz/app/2l/page.tsx
    task: |
      Major restructure of 2L page from 11 sections to 7:

      REMOVE imports for: AgentVisualization, CodeGenDemo, SlashCommands
      REMOVE data arrays: agents (6 cards), benefits (old structure)

      NEW SECTION ORDER:
      1. Hero - "Ship Complete Systems in Days, Not Months"
         Subhead: "2L coordinates AI agents to build, validate, and deploy your project faster than traditional development."

      2. Watch a Complete Build (unified demo)
         - TerminalAnimation component
         - Below: 4-column metrics (same as LiveDashboard but inline, showing customer-portal metrics)

      3. The Promise - "What You Get"
         - 3-column grid: Speed | Quality | Visibility
         - Speed: "Days, not months" / "Parallel execution"
         - Quality: "Self-healing validation" / "Automated testing"
         - Visibility: "Real-time progress" / "Full audit trail"

      4. How It Works - "Four Steps to Shipped"
         - 4 horizontal steps (replace 7 phases):
         1. Vision - "You describe what you need"
         2. Plan - "AI architects the solution"
         3. Build - "Parallel agents execute"
         4. Ship - "Validated, tested, deployed"

      5. What Makes 2L Different - "Not Just Code Generation"
         - 3 cards:
         1. Self-Healing: "Validation fails? System fixes itself."
         2. Parallel Execution: "Multiple features built simultaneously"
         3. Audit Trail: "Every decision logged and traceable"

      6. Under the Hood - KEEP accordion as-is

      7. CTA - KEEP, minor copy update

  - builder_id: 3
    name: "Cleanup & Verification"
    files:
      - /home/ahiya/Ahiya/2L/Prod/ahiya-xyz/app/components/2l/LiveDashboard.tsx
    task: |
      LiveDashboard component is still needed for the unified demo.
      Update it to show "customer-portal" metrics instead of "ahiya-xyz" metrics:

      New metrics:
      - "3" - Parallel Builders (was Plans Completed)
      - "47" - Tests Passing (was Iterations Shipped)
      - "4" - Hours to Deploy (was Agents Spawned)
      - "1" - Unified Codebase (was Validation Passes)

      Update the header badge:
      - Remove "This site was built with 2L"
      - Change to: "Build in Progress: customer-portal"

      Update footer:
      - Remove "Real metrics from building this portfolio site"
      - Change to: "Simulated build - actual 2L projects follow this flow"

parallel_builders: [1, 3]
sequential_builders: [2]  # Builder 2 depends on Builder 1 for terminal changes

validation_criteria:
  - TypeScript compilation passes
  - ESLint passes
  - Build succeeds
  - 2L page has exactly 7 main sections
  - No meta-circular "this page" references
  - "customer-portal" appears in demo content
