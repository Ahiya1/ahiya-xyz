strategy: |
  Transform ahiya.xyz from philosophical site to business portfolio through a
  3-iteration approach: (1) Archive & Foundation - move all existing content to
  /soul/* while fixing critical performance and accessibility issues, (2) Portfolio
  & Business Content - create new business homepage with portfolio section, "How I
  Work" section, and contact section using reusable components from existing code,
  (3) Polish & SEO - update metadata, add JSON-LD structured data, optimize images,
  and ensure Core Web Vitals compliance.

  Key findings from exploration:
  - 10 existing pages (~7,500 LOC) need archival to /soul/*
  - ~50+ internal links need updating
  - 4 portfolio projects to showcase: Mirror of Dreams, Wealth, StatViz, AI Research Pipeline
  - Critical fixes: duplicate font loading, oversized logos (344KB → <50KB), missing mobile nav
  - No database/backend - purely static site
  - Modern stack (Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4) - no dependency issues

  Risk mitigations:
  - Archive first to ensure zero content loss
  - Add redirects in next.config.ts for SEO preservation
  - Reuse existing card/animation patterns from building/page.tsx
  - Optimize images before adding portfolio screenshots

    name: "Archive & Foundation"
    vision: "Safely preserve all philosophical content at /soul/* and fix critical performance issues"
    scope: |
      ## Phase 1: Archive to /soul
      - Create app/soul/ directory structure
      - Move all 10 existing pages to soul subdirectory:
        - / → /soul (current homepage becomes /soul)
        - /building → /soul/building
        - /connect → /soul/connect
        - /journey → /soul/journey
        - /writing → /soul/writing
        - /writing/sacred-potato → /soul/writing/sacred-potato
        - /blueprint/* → /soul/blueprint/*
      - Update ~50+ internal Link hrefs with /soul prefix
      - Add 301 redirects in next.config.ts for SEO preservation
      - Create app/soul/layout.tsx with philosophical metadata
      - Verify all animations and effects still work at new URLs

      ## Phase 2: Critical Performance Fixes
      - Remove duplicate font @import from globals.css (keep next/font only)
      - Optimize logo images: resize to actual display sizes, convert to WebP
        - logo-symbol.png: 1024x1024 (140KB) → 64x64 WebP (<5KB)
        - logo-text.png: 1024x1024 (204KB) → 640x320 WebP (<20KB)
      - Remove maximumScale: 1 from viewport config (accessibility fix)

      ## Phase 3: Mobile Navigation
      - Add hamburger menu component for mobile devices
      - Implement slide-out or dropdown navigation
      - Ensure proper focus management and keyboard accessibility

      ## Validation Criteria
      - All pages accessible at /soul/* URLs
      - All internal links work correctly
      - All animations function as before
      - No console errors
      - Lighthouse performance score improved
      - Mobile navigation functional on all devices
