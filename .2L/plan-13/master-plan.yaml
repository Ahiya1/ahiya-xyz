    name: "Pipeline Visualization"
    files:
      - /home/ahiya/Ahiya/2L/Prod/ahiya-xyz/app/components/2l/PipelineVisualization.tsx
    task: |
      Create the 7-phase pipeline visualization replacing the 4-step version.

      Seven phases:
      1. Vision (Target icon) - "Describe what you need"
      2. Exploration (Search icon) - "Analyze the landscape"
      3. Planning (FileText icon) - "Architect the solution"
      4. Building (Hammer icon) - "Execute in parallel"
      5. Integration (GitMerge icon) - "Merge with precision"
      6. Validation (Shield icon) - "Verify quality gates"
      7. Healing (RefreshCw icon) - "Self-correct if needed"

      Visual treatment:
      - Horizontal flow on desktop, vertical on mobile
      - Glowing circular nodes with icons
      - Animated connection lines between phases
      - Active phase pulses (cycle through on interval)

      CSS classes for animations:
      - pipeline-node-active: pulse glow
      - pipeline-line-flow: gradient animation along lines

    name: "Page Restructure & CSS"
    files:
      - /home/ahiya/Ahiya/2L/Prod/ahiya-xyz/app/2l/page.tsx

         Use <InvoiceFlowDemo /> component
      3. Built by 2L Badge
         Use <BuiltBy2LBadge /> component
         Small, subtle, after demo
      4. The Pipeline - "Seven Phases, Zero Guesswork"
         Use <PipelineVisualization /> component
         Replace current 4-step version
      5. The Promise (keep current 3-column)
      6. What Makes 2L Different (keep current)
      7. Under the Hood - "The Agent Architecture"
         Use <AgentCards /> component
         Replace current accordion
      8. CTA (keep current)

      IMPORTS to add:
      - InvoiceFlowDemo
      - PipelineVisualization
      - AgentCards
      - BuiltBy2LBadge

      IMPORTS to remove:
      - Remove 'steps' array (replaced by PipelineVisualization)
      - Keep 'promise' and 'differentiators' arrays
      - Keep 'technicalItems' for potential future use

      CSS ANIMATIONS to add to globals.css:
      ```css
      /* Agent card glows */
      .agent-glow-cyan { ... }
      .agent-glow-purple { ... }
      .agent-glow-green { ... }
      .agent-glow-blue { ... }
      .agent-glow-gold { ... }
      .agent-glow-orange { ... }

      /* Pipeline animations */
      @keyframes pipeline-pulse { ... }
      @keyframes pipeline-flow { ... }

      /* Card breathing */
      @keyframes agent-breathe {
        0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
        50% { transform: scale(1.02); }
      }
      ```

parallel_builders: [1, 2, 3, 4]
sequential_builders: [5]  # Builder 5 depends on components from 1-4

validation_criteria:
  - TypeScript compilation passes
  - ESLint passes
  - Build succeeds
  - 2L page has 8 sections
  - InvoiceFlow demo shows 3 phases + output
  - Pipeline shows 7 phases with animations
  - Agent cards show 7 agents with glows
  - "Built by 2L" badge is visible but subtle
