strategy: |
  Single iteration with 6 parallel builders for "Undeniably Premium & Alive" transformation.

  All 4 master explorers recommend SINGLE ITERATION due to:
  - Navigation fix is simple (10 min)
  - PDF generation is self-contained
  - Demos are independent per project
  - Animation work is additive enhancement

  Critical path:
  1. Builder-1 fixes navigation FIRST (blocks nothing but critical)
  2. Builder-2 creates PDF system (independent)
  3. Builder-3 animates 2L page (independent)
  4. Builder-4 creates StatViz + Wealth demos (independent)
  5. Builder-5 creates Mirror + AI Pipeline demos (independent)
  6. Builder-6 adds global animations + polish (can run parallel)

  Key technical decisions from exploration:
  - PDF: @react-pdf/renderer with build-time generation
  - Animations: CSS-first with Intersection Observer for scroll triggers
  - Demos: React hooks only (useState, useEffect), no external libraries
  - "How I Work" copy fix included in Builder-1

iterations:

    global_iteration: 10
    name: "Undeniably Premium & Alive"
    vision: "Transform site from pretty premium to undeniably premium - fix navigation, create real PDF, animate 2L page, build custom project demos, make everything alive"
    scope: |
      Builder-1: Navigation Fix + Copy Fixes (CRITICAL - do first)
        - Fix Navigation.tsx to use Link for internal routes
        - Change "How We Work" to "How I Work" in page.tsx
        - Quick win, unblocks testing

      Builder-2: PDF Generation System
        - Install @react-pdf/renderer
        - Create /scripts/generate-capabilities-pdf.tsx
        - Generate PDF at build time to /public/capabilities.pdf
        - Redesign /app/capabilities/page.tsx as landing page
        - Add download button to homepage CTA strip

        - Animate pipeline diagram (sequential phase lighting)
        - Add floating/pulsing agent icons
        - Add count-up animation for metrics
        - Enhanced hover states on cards
        - Make the meta-reference shine ("7 plans, 10 iterations")

      Builder-4: StatViz + Wealth Interactive Demos
        - StatViz: Animated bar chart, toggle views, counting metrics
        - Wealth: Ticking balance, animated categories, transaction list
        - Replace generic MockupElement with custom components

      Builder-5: Mirror of Dreams + AI Pipeline Demos
        - Mirror: Cosmic background, AI typing effect, ethereal glow

        - Replace generic MockupElement with custom components

      Builder-6: Global Animations + Premium Polish
        - Fix section-reveal to use Intersection Observer
        - Add useCountUp hook for metrics everywhere
        - Typography improvements (font weights, letter-spacing)
        - Enhanced hover states on all interactive elements
        - Spacing improvements between sections
