  Single iteration approach for transforming all 4 project pages into phenomenal
  mini-experiences. All features are interdependent and splitting would create
  inconsistent pages. Work includes:

  1. CSS-only scroll animations (fix broken useScrollReveal)
  2. Visual mockups for each project (HTML-based representations)
  3. GitHub links with lock icons for private repos
  4. Tech deep-dive sections explaining "why" each technology
  5. Metrics sections with concrete numbers
  6. Enhanced "Next Project" navigation with preview cards
  7. Staggered hero animations

  Implementation order:
  - globals.css first (foundation)
  - One page as template (statviz - simplest)
  - Apply pattern to remaining 3 pages
  - Content/assets last
